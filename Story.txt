You're a "Wall Street" broker, and you've fradulently promised that you'd be able to double the amount of money invested within 100 days...

Unforunately, your computer science degree has left you ill-prepared to deal with the fast-paced changes of a volatile stock market. You decide to forgo the penny stocks and just invest in the blue chip stocks.

Will you be able to pay your clients? Or, will you break the bank and be prosecuted by the SEC?
